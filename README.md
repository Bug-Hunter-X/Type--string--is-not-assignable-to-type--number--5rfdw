# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The `add` function expects two numbers as arguments, but a string is passed as the second argument. This results in a type error.

The `bug.ts` file contains the code with the error. The `bugSolution.ts` file contains a corrected version of the code.
